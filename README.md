# ElectricityConsumption_TimeSeries
In this project, we dive into the electricity data of a factory, aiming to predict consumption patterns for cost-effective operations. Our goal is to empower the factory with insights for smarter energy management and sustainable practices.

## Components

### R-Markdown Files

- [R-Markdown File](link/to/exploratory_analysis.Rmd): This file contains code and analysis for exploring the characteristics of the electricity consumption data. It includes visualizations to identify patterns, trends, anomalies and the selection of time series model for forecasting.

### Report PDF

- [Report](link/to/exploratory_analysis.Rmd): A comprehensive report summarizing the findings and results of the time series analysis. It includes insights into electricity consumption patterns, model performance, and recommendations for the factory.
